~~1. retrain PEPE/ENA/DOGE on kucoinperp~~
2. tweak token params

## Shift notes

did a rfq trade with okex today where we bought 4000 eth premium i.e. (sell spot buy perp) at 0 (was trading around +3.9bps) and had -7m position then.  if we settle out of 2jane like what we did, will get maker rebates (0.5 bps) for 1 leg but if settle out of ldn + 2jane, then will get 0.5+0.5=1bp rebate.  customer's hard limit is 0 offer, so can ping them if premium goes higher.  to hedge the okex perp leg, dont need to change perp local skew because of mab.  instead, can tweak trading params to hedge faster
- sometimes get big deltas from defi for SOL, increase the global skew if we don't hedge fast enough and make sure we don't push the price against ourselves
- just setup AVNT trading, cant wd from coinbase due to 24h timer for wl so set a local skew + local bal max
