i've implemented a component (adl defender) to move our positions to desk 9 and back immediately on binancefutures to reduce our unrealized pnl. This lowers our adl queue priority and reduces the chance of ADL. Technical details in the thread.


for each desk (1 till 9)
we get all symbols excluding majors (btc,eth,sol,xrp,bnb) and 
1. filter if the unrealized pnl > 10k + unrealized_pnl/notional > 0.05
2. sort by adl_quartile, pnl_percentage and pick the top 10
3. clamp quantity by a max notional of 5M per symbol (configurable) and cur_lev_max_pos on desk 9
4. check risk that desk 9 has enough margin to support the list of symbols and add symbols till risk check is not met
5. risk is configured such that after the move, the margin level > 0.1 so in the worst case, we will have a 10% buffer on price moves
6. margin is calculated by the exact same way the binancefutures balance v4 does it

other details:
1. if the first transfer leg fails (e.g. because we made a trade), will just skip that desk and will retry again in the next loop
2. if the second transfer leg fails, component will be killed because we expect that position should always be able to be moved back
3. cases when the transfer desk also holds some position is considered
4. api only reduces positions, so we can never open positions by transferring between sub-accounts
5. desk 8 is transfer desk for desk 9 (8 and 9 are chosen because they have the largest margin)
