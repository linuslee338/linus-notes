# Shift stuff


## Tasks to do on shift
- do otcs
- check slack alerts / healthscript
- check best/worst trading tokens
- check deltas
- chase transfers




## My first shift handover message
- quite a bit of otc flow today
- prospect has been trading in many small clips today and is net burn but we are giving good price as they are good potential cp acc to bd (should try to bundle the trades and settle together)
- struggling to hedge VINU (turned submerine on and skewed 50bps), getting more revolut flow than we can hedge on bybit and market up 10% today
- fiat slightly more back in line but still trading above. waiting for eur/gbp on natwest
- funding good for a bunch of alts incl. pump/ena/fartcoin so can keep an eye
- lowered ENA perp balance from -10m to -15m cos funding is good


- trading pretty quiet, bunch of unrealised perp_pospnl
- GAME moggin it
