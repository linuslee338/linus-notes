# Shift stuff


## Tasks to do on shift
- do otcs
- check slack alerts / healthscript
- check best/worst trading tokens
- check deltas
- chase transfers




## My first shift handover message
- quite a bit of otc flow today
- prospect has been trading in many small clips today and is net burn but we are giving good price as they are good potential cp acc to bd (should try to bundle the trades and settle together)
- struggling to hedge VINU (turned submerine on and skewed 50bps), getting more revolut flow than we can hedge on bybit and market up 10% today
- fiat slightly more back in line but still trading above. waiting for eur/gbp on natwest
- funding good for a bunch of alts incl. pump/ena/fartcoin so can keep an eye
- lowered ENA perp balance from -10m to -15m cos funding is good


- trading pretty quiet, bunch of unrealised perp_pospnl
- GAME moggin it

- nl from 2 joselito clips tdy
- manta finished hedging
- we need to settle around 6 more clips of wbtc with OKX (was booked as an otc, so will need to edit man bal as we do more trades). price already agreed on, just need to settle via okx rfq on website
- fiat trading slightly under throughout the day, so make sure inventory is topped up all ard
- there was an entry that was added into dynamic_params db with param_name `btc/usdt_p__balance` which crashed binancefutures risk.  not sure how this appeared in db as the param name shouldn't exist so deleted from db and restarted.  couldn't figure out the cause and saw that this happened b4 and was left unresolved




nl is from hl spot eth/btc twap. theres one other guy in the market, when he runs out of inventory, we can sell at ard 100 bps
aero upbit listing in the morning, seems to be in line now
spun up SKL cos of good market dq in past few days (can watch trading and close it if its not profitable)
